# Proposal: Add Dark Mode

## Intent
Users have requested a dark mode option to reduce eye strain
during nighttime usage and match system preferences.

## Scope
In scope:
- Theme toggle in settings
- System preference detection
- Persist preference in localStorage

Out of scope:
- Custom color themes (future work)
- Per-page theme overrides

## Approach
Use CSS custom properties for theming with a React context
for state management. Detect system preference on first load,
allow manual override.
